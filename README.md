# Lever

Unoffical gem to access the [Lever](https://www.lever.co/) v1 API.

From Lever:
> The Lever API lets you build a variety of applications and scripts to create candidates, integrate Lever with other business platforms (HRIS, HRMS, etc.), and show Lever data outside of the app.

NOTE: This is NOT for the Postings API

From Lever:
> Hoping to build an integration with your public job site? You're probably looking for the Postings API.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lever'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lever

```

then, use the resource name as a method, and supply the ID to get a singular object.

```ruby
client.opportunities # list opportunities
client.opportunities(opportunity_id) # single opportunity
```
